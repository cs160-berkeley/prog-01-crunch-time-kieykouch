# PROG 01: Crunch Time

This is an Android application to calculate the calories based on the amounts of repetition or duration (minute) for an exercise. User can select up to 12 exercises, such as:
<br> - Pushup (350 Reps = 100 Calories)
<br> - Situp (200 Reps = 100 Calories)
<br> - Squats (225 Reps = 100 Calories)
<br> - Leg-lift (25 Minutes = 100 Calories)
<br> - Plank (25 Minutes = 100 Calories)
<br> - Jumping Jacks (10 Minutes = 100 Calories)
<br> - Pullup (100 Reps = 100 Calories)
<br> - Cycling (12 Minutes = 100 Calories)
<br> - Walking (20 Minutes = 100 Calories)
<br> - Jogging (12 Minutes = 100 Calories)
<br> - Swimming (13 Minutes = 100 Calories)
<br> - Stair-Climbing (15 Minutes = 100 Calories)

In addition, a user can see the equivalent amount of minutes/reps for any other exercise to get the same calories like the current selected exercise, by selecting the spinner at the button of the app. This conversion app can take up to 16 digits of rep/minutes. This app works in both orientation, portrait and landscape.
